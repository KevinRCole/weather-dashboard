## April 2, 2022

This is a UW Coding Bootcamp project that requires me to use JavaScript, HTML, CSS, jQuery and other third-party APR's to manipulate and display on a web page weather data for cities that a user selects using the webpage as a user interface.  I am required to use Fetch to call the date from the OpenWeather API.

## Description

I have not yet completed this project.  I have thus far made a rough draft of the web page, usin HTML and CSS, and I have programed the webpage to download weather data from from OpenWeather API using vanilla JavaScript and Fetch.  I still must call five-day forecast data from the OpenWeather API, and UV Index data, and I still must use JavaScript to display all of this weather data on the webpage.  I must also create a city search history and display it on the webpage as well.

## Credits

I have been relying on information provided by UW Coding Bootcamp, including classwork, lectures, and supplemental BootCamp materials, and information I have found on the web.
